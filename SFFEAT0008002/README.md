# Problem Statement
New design for Contact form launched May 15, 2022.
*	Visits have increased by 70% (19K to 32K avg monthly) due to three CTAs (Get Started, contact floater, and Contact footer) now pointing visitors to the Contact Us form.
*	Submissions have decreased by 24% (2K to 1.5K avg monthly). 
*	Submission rate has decreased from 11% to 5%. 

# Hypothesis

*	"Continue" button was added as first step in the form experience as part of the redesign. About 8% of visits clicked on the Continue button to view the full form experience.
*	Two step form adds friction to the form conversion and 900 visitors* abandon after display of complete form per month.
*	No indication for mandatory fields and error message design is also an area of friction
